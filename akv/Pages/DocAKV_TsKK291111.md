    Declaration
</div>


I declare that I am leaving the Opposition. I consider the general line of the party to be
correct. I find my factional activity in my past to be incorrect, and renounce it. I also
consider incorrect the Opposition's claim that the party leadership is capable of searching
for a way out of difficulties only along right-wing paths. I condemn Trotsky's activity,
including and especially his activity abroad. I remove my signature from factional documents.
All resolutions of the leading party organs are obligatory for me. I ask that you accept me
into the ranks of the VKP(b).

A. Voronsky.

11/XI/29. Address: Moscow, First House of the Soviets, No. 217.
